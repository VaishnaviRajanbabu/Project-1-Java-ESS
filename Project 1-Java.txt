COMPILER:
Programming Steps:
                  Write a program in source code.
                  Compile will analyze your program statements and check their correctness. If an error is found in a program, it throws an error message.
                  If the program contains no error, then the compiler will convert the source code program into machine code.
                  The compiler links all the code files into a single runnable program, which is known as the exe file.
                  Finally, it runs the program and generates output.    
Translation type:
                 A compiler translates complete high-level programming code into machine code at once.
INTERPRETER:
Programming Steps:
                  Write a program in source code.
                  No linking of files happens, or no machine code will generate separately.
                  The source code programming statements are executed line-by-line during their execution.
                  If an error is found at any specific statement interpreter, it stops further execution until the error gets removed.
Translation type:
                 An interpreter translates one statement of programming code at a time into machine code.
